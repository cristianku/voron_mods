# BTT_CANBUS
Modified canbus holder for BTT CANBUS connectors.

They are coming in 3 different connectors. Now you should probably get the bigger one.

It has changed in terms of internal wire for the power, seems to be 18 awg now.
<br>

But the connector is different and since its needed a modified version of the Canbus Cable holder.

I had to slightly retouch the CW2 bridge, so that it matches better with the USB-c and therefore the entire assembly of the cable holder.

I have also reinforced the holding, by putting two screws there between the Bridge and the Connector Holder , so that it will not turn around.

You will need to file a bit after the 3d printing, but only on this face :
